# Import kmos.types

# Initialize a project

# Set projects metadata: author, email,  model name and model dimension

# Define a layer with one site, add it to the project

# Add surface species

# Define model parameters..

# Define Processes
#   Generate auxiliary coordinates

#   Define both adsorption processes

#   and both desorption processes

# Alternatively, define processes programatically

# Save the model to an xml file
